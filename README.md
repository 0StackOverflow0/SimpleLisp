# SimpleLisp
Simple Lisp interpreter project

Orignally made during a weekend trip to Portland, and somewhat refined over the next two weeks.

Not meant to be efficient, but it was a fairly literal interpratation of LISP and Atoms.

Can run fibonaci at lower input levels, and define new functions. I believe let is in there too.
